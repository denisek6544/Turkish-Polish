You have completed every lesson. CONGRATULATIONS!
You have worked really hard and you have made it!
You should still go back and review lessons you're not confident with yet.
It would be advised to re-take tests and try out that revision test so you can perfect them.
Also, if you  don't practice, you will lose it, so review on occasion.
Good job making it all the way to the end! You have learned so much.
I hope you now understand the meaning of the program's name, Turkish Polish.
By now you must have really polished your vocabulary.
Be proud of your progress.
Thank you!
