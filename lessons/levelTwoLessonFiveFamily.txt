Lesson Five: Family

Something that is different about family terms in English and Turkish is that your mom's mom,
and dad's mom aren't both referred to as grandma. You'll see the distinction between
maternal and paternal down below!

English              Turkish

family             = aile
mom                = anne
dad                = baba
parent             = ebeveyn
grandma (maternal) = anneanne
grandma (paternal) = babaanne
grandpa            = dede
son                = oğul
daughter           = kız
child              = çocuk
grand-daughter     = kız torun
grand-son          = erkek torun
grand-child        = torun
sister             = kız kardeş
brother            = erkek kardeş
sibling            = kardeş
niece/nephew       = yeğen
aunt (maternal)    = teyze
uncle (maternal)   = dayı
aunt (paternal)    = hala
uncle (paternal)   = amca
