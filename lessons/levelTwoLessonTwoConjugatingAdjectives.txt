Good job learning those adjectives!
Now let's conjugate them!

Lesson Two: Conjugating Adjectives

In English, we say:
we are slow

In Turkish it would be:
biz yavaşız

slow is yavaş so to show that we are you conjugate the adjective to be yavaşız
In Turkish you do not need to say "biz" because it is implied with the ending of the adjective,
because there is a unique ending for each person.
Here they are:

Person    Ending
Ben       im
Sen       sin
O         -
Biz       iz
Siz       siniz
Onlar     lar

Depending on the adjective, the vowel of the ending can be different.
Ex. happy = mutlu
    I am happy = mutluyum
    
Refer back to level one less five if you're unsure of the vowel rule.
    
It's complicated but it gets easier with practice

To learn, go back to the list of adjectives and try conjugating them.
