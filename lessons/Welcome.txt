Hello!
Welcome to Turkish Polish!
With this program you will be able to brush up on your Turkish vocabulary.
Expect some lessons to independently review and learn new words.
Afterwards there will be some practice tests to see what you need to improve on.
Whether you're just starting off or are starting to get a good grasp on the language,
There will be some new words for you to learn!
I hope you're ready to commit to polishing your Turkish!
It's time for you to pick your level.
Where do you think you're at?
Level One would be for those of us who know no Turkish.
No worries, with a little hard work, you'll get there!
Level Two is for you if you if you know a little bit of the basics.
There's still much to learn.
Level Three is your level if you can put together phrases in Turkish,
But you're still missing some key words.
Level Four is last. Don't be intimidated it's not advanced, we're all learning after all.
In this level, you can expect to brush up on some words that aren't commonly used in conversation.

Happy learning!
